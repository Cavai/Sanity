- [Coding style](coding-style)
- [Fix bugs by creating PR's](fix-bugs-by-creating-prs)
- [Share an RFC for new features or big changes](share-an-rfc-for-new-features-or-big-changes)

## Coding style

Sanity is written in Vue 2. Having a brief knowledge of Vue is required to contribute.

## Fix bugs by creating PR's

We appreciate every time you report a bug. However, taking time to submit a PR can help us in fixing bugs quickly and ensure a healthy and stable eco-system.

Go through the following points, before creating a new PR.

1. Create an issue discussing the bug or short-coming.
2. Once approved, go ahead and fork the REPO.
3. Make sure to start from the `main`, since this is the upto date branch.
4. Make sure to keep commits small and relevant.
5. Once done with all the changes, create a PR against the `main` branch.

## Share an RFC for new features or big changes

Sharing PR's for small changes works great. However, when contributing big features, it is required to go through the RFC process.

### What is an RFC?

RFC stands for **Request for Comment**, a standard process.

In brief, RFC process allows you to talk about the changes with everyone in the community and get a view of the core team before dedicating your time to work on the feature.

The RFC proposals are created as issues on this repo. Prefix them with `[RFC]` to make them easily distinguishable from other issues.
