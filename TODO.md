- Switch moment to alternative lightweight time manipulation library
- Switch into GraphQL API

- Table summary / pagination (like in Cloud)
- Table search (link in Cloud (maybe like in GH with support for @assignee: olszewa))

REQUESTS
- Commits (+ sparkline)
- Do not show commits for closed pulls to avoid rendering too many data in table
